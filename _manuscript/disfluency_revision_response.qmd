Thank you for giving us the opportunity to revise and resubmit our manuscript, “The Perceptual Disfluency Effect: A Drift Diffusion and Ex-Gaussian Analysis” (Manuscript ID: JOC-2025-0043). We greatly appreciate the insightful and constructive comments provided by the Editor and Reviewers. These suggestions were extremely helpful in guiding our revisions, and we have used them to substantially improve the clarity, structure, and presentation of the manuscript.

Some of the general changes include restructuring the paper to make it more streamlined, trimming its overall length, moving the discussion of drift-diffusion modeling (DDM) to the appendix, and updating the title.

Below, we describe in detail how we have revised the paper in response to the Editor’s and Reviewers’ comments. The Editor’s and Reviewers’ comments are cited or summarized in [red italicized text]{.memo-reviewer-inline}, and our responses are provided in standard black Roman text. We also include excerpts from the revised manuscript in [blue text]{.memo-excerpt-inline}.

## Main Concerns

::: memo-reviewer
***Reviewer 1***:  A central point I would encourage the authors to consider is how the experimental design—specifically, the intermixed vs. blocked presentation of stimuli—may influence the observed disfluency effects and consequently, the interpretation of the results.  The current design, which randomly intermixes clear, low-blur, and high-blur words, may limit the ecological validity of the findings, particularly in light of the educational implications suggested.
In real-world reading scenarios (e.g., reading a book or handwritten notes), perceptual characteristics such as font, handwriting, or blur are typically consistent across longer stretches of text. This consistency enables parafoveal processing and the generation of visual and orthographic predictions about upcoming stimuli. In contrast, an intermixed design reduces such predictability, and may even suppress predictive processing altogether.
:::

We would like to thank the reviewer for bringing up this point, and we fully agree that is a potential limitation of the study. Some of my work (@geller2018) and also @rosner2015 has showed that some types of disfluency (handwritten cursve and high blurring) elicits the effect regardless of design (mixed vs. pure/blocked design). We opted for a mixed design becasue of this is, but to your point, it is not ecologically valid.  We have added this to point to our discussion.

Second, all three experiments employed a mixed-list design. Although perceptual disfluency effects have been observed with both mixed and pure/blocked designs [@geller2018; @rosner2015], the mixed-list paradigm is not representative of typical classroom contexts.

***Reviewer 1***: From a theoretical standpoint, it may be worthwhile to discuss these results in relation to the prediction error framework, and more specifically the orthographic prediction error model (e.g., Gagl et al., 2020, NeuroImage). This model suggests that reading involves generating visual-orthographic predictions, which are compared against input to update lexical representations. If prediction is impaired or suspended due to unpredictability in stimulus appearance (as in the current intermixed design), then top-down facilitation mechanisms may be attenuated—potentially altering both response time distributions and memory outcomes.
:::

We would like to thank Reviewer 1 for suggesting Gagl et al. (2020). We have now incorporated discussion of the orthographic prediction error model in conjunction with the stage-specific account.

::: memo-excerpt
Converging neuroimaging and neurophysiological evidence supports this interpretation. @gagl2020 proposed the orthographic prediction error (OPE) model, which holds that reading words involves generating visual–orthographic predictions and comparing them to incoming input. Visual degradation increases OPE—the mismatch between expected and observed letter input—and when predictions are impaired or suspended due to stimulus unpredictability, the benefits of top-down facilitation are attenuated. As a result, processing relies more heavily on bottom-up input, which can slow responses and alter encoding quality. This perspective clarifies how perceptual disfluency can influence both response-time distributions and memory outcomes, while also situating the stage-specific account within a broader predictive-processing framework. Future research can helf edify this.

***Reviewer 1***: Future work might consider using blocked designs to evaluate whether consistent disfluency allows for better predictive calibration and whether this modulates the interaction between perceptual encoding and memory. Clarifying these dynamics could enrich the theoretical grounding. It would also facilitate constraints for applying perceptual disfluency manipulations in educational settings.
:::

Thank you for this thoughtful suggestion. As noted above, prior research using blurred text has indeed observed perceptual disfluency effects in blocked (or pure) designs, and I have cited this work in the manuscript. I agree that further studies directly manipulating blocked versus mixed designs would provide valuable insight into how consistency in disfluency influences predictive calibration and the interplay between encoding and memory. Such work would also help clarify the conditions under which perceptual disfluency might be harnessed in applied or educational contexts.

We have fixed this grammatical error in the paper.

***Reviewer 1***:  p 14, line 59: “Another scenario entails a general slow down of processing—causing distributional shifting μ, but not skewing”.  “but not skewing”.. Would it be better with “not an increase in skewing”?
:::

::: memo-excerpt
Another scenario entails a general slowing of processing, reflected in an increase in $\mu$  but not in $\tau$.

***Reviewer 1***:  p 5 line 48: “Originally launched with the strong claim that typeface enhances memory retention due to the backward-slanting letters and gaps within each letter which forces individuals to ‘generate’ the missing parts of each word” . Please check grammar.

It was originally launched with the strong claim that typeface enhances memory retention because of the backward-slanting letters and the gaps within each letter, which force individuals to “generate” the missing parts of each word.
